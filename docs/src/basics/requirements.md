# Requirements

There are only 2 requirements:

- Node JS v4+ - required to run the core
- [Redis](redis.md) - required for persistence for the core (other persistence options TBA)

Also, you will need to create a Node JS application to [start the core](starting.md).
This application will require the Node-RED package available on [NPM](http://npmjs.org).
See [homenet-app] for an example.

To get the most out of core, you will want to install some plugins for both homenet and for Node-RED.
