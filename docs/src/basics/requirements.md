# Requirements

There are only 2 requirements:

- [Node JS v4+](https://nodejs.org/en/) - required to run the core
- [Redis](redis.md) - required for persistence for the core (other persistence options TBA)

To get the most out of core, you will want to install some plugins for both homenet and for Node-RED.
